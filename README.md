# milia

Milia is a multi-accounting gem for hosted Rails 4.0.x applications which use
the devise gem for user authentication and registrations. Milia comes with 
tailoring for common use cases needing multi-accounting with user authentication.

## Basic concepts for the milia multi-accounting gem

### multi-accounting highlights

* should be transparent to the main application code
* should be symbiotic with user authentication
* should raise exceptions upon attempted illegal access
* should force accounting (not allow sloppy access to all account records)
* should allow application flexibility upon new account sign-up, 
  usage of eula information, etc
* should be as non-invasive (as possible) to Rails code
* row-based accounting is used
* default_scope is used to enforce accounting

The author used schema-based accounting in the past but found it deficient for
the following reasons: most DBMS are optimized to handle enormous number of
rows but not an enormous number of schema (tables). Schema-based tenancy took a
performance hit, was seriously time-consuming to backup and restore, was invasive
into the Rails code structure (monkey patching), was complex to implement, and
couldn't use Rails migration tools as-is.

### accounts/users vs organizations/members

A account == an organization; users == members of the organization. 
Only organizations sign up for new accounts, not members (users).  
The very first user of an organization, let's call him the Organizer, 
is the one responsible for initiating the organizational signup.
The Organizer becomes the first member (user) of the organization (account). 
Thereafter, other members only obtain entry to the organization (account) 
by invitation. New accounts are not created for every new user.

## Version

milia v1.0.0 is the release version for Rails 4.0.x and is now available for usage.

The last previous release version for Rails 3.2.x can be found in the git branch 'v0.3', but
it is essentially obsolete. Go with v1.0.x

## What's changed?

* Rails 4.0.x adapted (changes to terms, strong_parameters, default_scope, etc)
* Devise 3.2.x adapted
* All the changes which version 0.3.x advised to be inserted in applications_controller.rb are now automatically loaded into ActionController by milia.
* that includes authenticate_account!
* so if you've been using an older version of milia, you'll need to remove that stuff from applications_controller!
* generators for easy install of basic rails/milia/devise
* callback after successful authenticate_account!
* debug & info logging and trace for troubleshooting
* improved invite_member support
* revised README instructions

## Sample app and documentation

There were numerous requests for me to provide a complete sample web application
which uses milia and devise. I have done this. This README will have a brief section
on creating and installing the sample application. 

This sample app is now running on heroku and you may test it out here:
http://sample-milia.herokuapp.com
Instructions for deploying to heroku can be found in doc/sample.sh STEP 6 
within the milia gem.


Further details about this process can be found via the sources listed below:

* see doc/sample.sh for easy generator usage for setting up and creating a working app.
  Although all the same information is here in this README, it's perhaps clearer, and
  presented better, as a step-by-step instruction manual. This README must perforce be
  more as a reference manual.
* the sample app uses web-theme-app to provide some pleasantly formatted views for your testing pleasure.
* see doc/manual_sample.sh for complete step-by-step instructions for manually setting up and creating a working app.
* if you want to know exactly everything the generators are doing, see the manual_sample.sh
  - instructions are very detailed and loaded with comments (600 lines!).
  - Stage one: with simple devise and no milia, 
  - Stage two: installing milia for complete accounting,
  - Stage three: adding in invite_member capability
* the entire sample is also fully available on github, if you wish to check your work. diff can be your friend.
  this sample on github, however, will always be for the latest release or latest beta (whichever is most recent).
* find it at: https://github.com/dsaronin/sample-milia-app

### Available docmentation resources for milia

* doc/sample.sh -- this document will ALWAYS be the most recent
    (for example in the edge branch: "newdev")
* doc/manual_sample.sh -- non-generator-based instructions for manually editing files.
    (this may no longer be the most recent since further work will focus on the generators)
* doc/gemfile_addition.txt -- the additions to Gemfile needed for setting up the sample-milia-app
    
* github.com/milia/wiki/sample-milia-app-tutorial
    this should be the same as the manual_sample.sh doc for the current
    stable release (or last beta version); but markdown formatted
    https://github.com/dsaronin/milia/wiki/sample-milia-app-tutorial
* milia README (this document):
    - this will be the knowledgable programmer's digest of the essentials
    - and thus it won't cover some of the intricacies of actually
      implementing milia: either the tutorial or sample.sh will do that
    - if you're a first time milia implementer, please use both the 
      README and either of the two above documents for assistance: it will save you time.

## converting an existing app to multi-accounted

It is doable, but you'll need to first understand how milia basically is installed. I'd still recommend 
bringing up the sample-milia-app, getting it working, and then figuring out how to either graft it onto your app.
Or (recommended), grafting your app onto it. I prefer to work that way because it's based off of a pure Rails 4.0
and devise 3.2 install.

## Dependency requirements

* Rails 4.0.x
* Devise 3.2.x

## this readme is for v1.0.0  (fka v1.0.0-beta-7)
* changes in beta-7: model & controller testing is almost complete; 
  minor bug fixed;  mixed-in controller methods are now public, not
  private.

* changes in beta-6: user_params added to Account.create_new_account;
  ability to add additional whitelist parameters during config

* changes in beta-5: logging, callback, bug fixes

* changes in beta-4: 
  corrections to README for Gemfile requirements
  generator tests for requirements

* changes in beta-3: improved generators getting a new app started

* changes in beta-2: invite_member capability

### edge branch: "newdev"

If I'm actively developing, this can be in a state of flux. Use at your own risk.

## Authorized Roles

Milia doesn't have any requirements re roles for users. But you will probably need
something in your app to support different roles levels. Devise recommends cancan, but
I have not used it and do not know how it might affect milia. In my app, I used to use
ACL9 before it encountered version issues with Rails. Rather than debugging it, I spun
off my own simplified version which I use now with great success. The gem I wrote is
open sourced. It is called _kibali_ and is available at github: https://github.com/dsaronin/kibali. 
Kibali is a simple replacement for ACL9, a role-based authentication gem. 
I prefer the non-obstrusive nature of kibali and the clear-cut way it deliniates
roles for actions at the start of each controller. This simplicity was also in ACL9.
Kibali is primarily oriented for functioning as a before_action role authentication scheme for Rails controllers.

## Structure

* necessary models: user, account
* necessary migrations: user, account, accounts_users (join table)

You must understand which of your apps models will be accounted ( <i>acts_as_account</i> ) 
and which will be universal ( <i>acts_as_universal</i>). Universal data NEVER has critical user/company
information in the table. It is usually only for system-wide constants. For example, if you've put
too much user information in the users table, you'll need to seperate it out. by definition, the devise 
user table MUST be universal and should only contain email, encrypted password, and devise-required data.
ALL OTHER USER DATA (name, phone, address, etc) should be broken out into a accounted table (say called member_data)
which belongs_to :user, and in the User model, has_one :member_data. Ditto for organization (account or company)
information.

Most of your tables (except for pure join tables, users, and accounts) SHOULD BE accounted. You should rarely have
universal tables, even for things you consider to be system settings. At some time in the future, your accounts
(organizations) will want to tailor/customize this data. So might as well start off correctly by making the
table accounted. It costs you nothing to do so now at the beginning. It does mean that you will need to seed 
these tables whenever a new account (organizational account) is created.

Finally: 

* accounts = organizational accounts and are created via sign up, a one-time event. this also creates the 
first MEMBER of that account in your app who is usually the organizing admin. This person can then issue
invitations (below) to bring other members into the account on the app.
* members = members WITHIN a account and are created by invitation only; they do NOT sign up. An invitation is
sent to them, they click on an activate or confirm link, and then they become a member of a accounted group.
* The invitation process involves creating both a new user (within the current_account) and its corresponding
member_data records.
* ALL models (whether accounted or universal) are expected to have a field in the table labelled: account_id.
* YOUR CODE SHOULD NEVER EVER TRY TO CHANGE OR SET THE account_id OF A RECORD. milia will not allow it, milia
will check for deviance; milia will raise exceptions if it's wrong; and milia will override it to maintain integrity.
* Accounted records will have account_id set to the appropriate account automagically by milia.
* Universal records will have account_id always set to nil, automagically by milia; and references to any
universal table will ALWAYS expect this field to be nil.
* Pure join tables (has_and_belongs_to_many HABTM associations) get neither designation (account nor universal).
The way that rails accesses these ensures that it will validate the account of joined member. A pure HABTM join
table is created with generation such as follows:

```
  rails g migration CreateModel1sModel2sJoinTable model1s model2s
```

## Installation

This README describes two different ways to install:
* use of a milia generator to install itself and automate those
  tweaks for most use cases (recommended method)
* a bare minimum manual setup which requires many minor tweaks;
  those tweaks will be described in a later section.

Later sections of the README will enumerate:
* how to create a simple working sample rails/devise/milia application
* all the expected tweaks which the generator performed automatically
* advice on advanced usage of milia (from rake tasks, console)
* specifics about the milia API

  
## Creating and Installing a Rails/Milia/Devise Sample Application

### Getting started for the sample application

Multi-accounting, much like user authentication, exists within the large scheme of
an application. I recommend first creating and installing the following complete, but simple,
reference Rails application so that you can validate a working setup on your
system, and have a reference point for making changes to your own application.

### Environment setup

I put these in .bashrc for an Ubuntu system.

```
export PORT=3000
export RACK_ENV=development
export SMTP_ENTRY=<my smtp password>
# OPTIONAL: recaptcha keys
export RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY=6LeYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKpT
export RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY=6LeBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBgQBv
```

### Rails setup

This example shows getting starting a new rails project in an rvm environment and using
git (github) as the SCM, and expecting to use heroku (eventually) as the PaaS 
(Platform as a Service) provider. Note: foreman is available when you set up the
heroku toolbelt (see doc/sample.sh for more details).

This example will set everything up for milia AND devise (you won't need to do devise).
It assumes you won't use airbrake, you will use recaptcha for new account sign-ups,
and you will use invite_member capability. Skeleton user, account, and member models
will be created. Before you run db:migrate, you can add any additional fields to the
account and member models. User model really is primarily only used by devise, and so
you shouldn't add anything to this model as it's a universal model. Member is a accounted
model and so this is where all the information for a member should be kept.

```ruby
  $ cd projectspace   # if not there already

  $ rails new sample-milia-app --skip-bundle
  $ echo "sample-milia-app" > sample-milia-app/.ruby-gemset
  $ echo "2.0.0" > sample-milia-app/.ruby-version
  $ echo "web: bundle exec thin start -R config.ru -p \$PORT -e \$RACK_ENV" > sample-milia-app/Procfile
  $ rvm gemset create sample-milia-app
```

Change .gitignore to match your development environment.
I just copy my standard .gitignore from another project
but you can copy mine from sample-milia-app on github.

```
  $ cd sample-milia-app
  $ cp ../<an existing project>/.gitignore .

  $ git init
  $ git add --all .
  $ git commit -am 'initial commit'
  $ git remote add origin git@github.com:<git-user>/sample-milia-app.git
  $ git push -u origin master
```

### milia and devise setup

This sample web application depends on my updates to the web-app-theme, as
well as several other gems for the application, which need to be added 
to the Gemfile, before running the installer.  
You can directly import these into your Gemfile
by getting them from <i>doc/gemfile_addition.txt.</i>
After adding this addition to the Gemfile, please make sure the correct
milia branch is being designated (it sometimes points to edge branch).

```
   $ vim Gemfile
     G
     :r <path to milia gem>/doc/gemfile_addition.txt
     ZZ
   $ bundle install
```

### WARNING: don't go commando and try to change everything at once! Don't be a perfectionist and try to bring up a fully written app at once!

Just follow the instructions for creating the sample, exactly, step-by-step. 
Get the basics working. Then change, adapt, and spice to taste.
Please?! Because I'm more inclined to help you solve problems if you've started out by 
getting the sample working exactly as described! If you've tried to go off into the jungle on your own, you are, well, on
your own. And as they say, _"get out the way you got in!"_


#### complete generating the sample application

Running the generator below will completely install milia, devise, and a sample app. You will not
need to run the "milia:install" given above. You'll need to do the following:

```
  $ rails g milia:install --org_email='<your smtp email for dev work>'
  $ rails g web_app_theme:milia
```

NOTE: The above generator has an option to specify an email address to 
be used for sending emails for confirmation and account activation.

The generator set up basic information for
being able to send the confirmation & activation emails.
But, you might need to complete entering in your email and smtp
information in the following places:

*   _config/environments/development.rb_
*   _config/environments/production.rb_

#### create the database and migration
```
  $ rake db:create
  $ rake db:migrate
```

#### test by starting server:
```
  $ foreman start
```

#### open your browser to http://localhost:3000

And that's all you have to do!

## Milia Basic Installation (not needed if you used the generator above)

### Getting started for the Bare minimum setup

This is the mininum necessary for using milia with a Rails application. If you're new to Rails
(or Devise and Milia), then I'd recommend you skip this section and instead follow the instructions
(previous section above) for Creating and Installing a Rails/Milia/Devise Sample Application. 

<strong>In any case, do NOT do both installations.</strong>

If you'll be using the recaptcha option, then milia will generate expecting the following
environment variables (put them in .bashrc, with the correct keys):

```
export RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY=6LeYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKpT
export RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY=6LeBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBgQBv
```

### Steps for Bare minimum
Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
  gem 'devise', '~>3.2'
  gem 'milia', '~>1.0'
```

If you'll be working with any beta or leading edge version, specify as follows:

```
   gem 'milia', :git => 'git://github.com/dsaronin/milia.git', :branch => 'v1.0.0-beta-7'
```

Then,
```
  $ bundle install
  $ rails g milia:install --org_email='<your smtp email for dev work>'
```

Note: The milia generator has an option to specify an email address to be used for sending emails for 
confirmation and account activation. Also note that the milia generator runs two
devise generators.

Make any changes required to the generated migrations, then:
```
  $ rake db:create
  $ rake db:migrate
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installation Reference Manual

This information is for reference only. The two generators automatically perform
these changes when installing the sample application. Do NOT repeat these steps
if you followed the automatic installation of the sample application.

#### information and expectations

**The above generator did everthing that's required. This section
will explain why the generator did what it did. You won't need
to do any of these steps unless you decide to customize or adapt.**

#### User session required

Rails 4 now handles this with a gem:

```
  gem 'activerecord-session_store', github: 'rails/activerecord-session_store'
```

#### Generate a session migration

``` 
  $ rails g active_record:session_migration
```

### Devise setup

* See https://github.com/plataformatec/devise for how to set up devise.
* The current version of milia requires that devise use a *User* model.

```
  $ rails g devise:install
  $ rails g devise user
```

Add the following in <i>config/routes.rb</i> to the existing devise_for :users  :

```
  as :user do   #   *MUST* come *BEFORE* devise's definitions (below)
    match '/user/confirmation' => 'milia/confirmations#update', :via => :put, :as => :update_user_confirmation
  end

  devise_for :users, :controllers => { 
    :registrations => "milia/registrations",
    :confirmations => "milia/confirmations",
    :sessions => "milia/sessions", 
    :passwords => "milia/passwords", 
  }

```

Add the appropriate line below to <i>config/environments/</i>_ 
files <i>development.rb, production.rb, test.rb</i>_ (respectively below, editing hosts as appropriate for your app).
Make sure you've also correctly set up the ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings. If you're unclear as to how to 
do that, refer to the sample-milia-app.

```
  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }
  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'secure.simple-milia-app.com', :protocol => 'https' }
  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => "www.example.com" }
```

EDIT: <i>db/migrate/xxxxxxx_devise_create_users.rb</i>
and uncomment the confirmable section, it will then look as follows:

```
      ## Confirmable
      t.string   :confirmation_token
      t.datetime :confirmed_at
      t.datetime :confirmation_sent_at
      t.string   :unconfirmed_email # Only if using reconfirmable
```

and uncomment the confirmation_token index line to look as follows

```
    add_index :users, :confirmation_token,   :unique => true
```

and add above the t.timestamps line:

```
      # milia member_invitable
      t.boolean    :skip_confirm_change_password, :default => false

      t.references :account
```

edit <i>config/initializers/devise.rb</i> 
and change mailer_sender to be your from: email address

```
  config.mailer_sender = "my-email@simple-milia-app.com"
```

OPTIONAL (not required for milia): 
in the same initializer file, locate and uncomment the following lines:

```
  config.pepper = '46f2....'
  config.confirmation_keys = [ :email ]
  config.email_regexp = /\A[^@]+@[^@]+\z/
```

### Milia setup

#### migrations

*ALL* models require a accounting field, whether they are to be universal or to
be accounted. So make sure the following is added to each migration:

<i>db/migrate/xxxxxxx_create_modelXYZ.rb</i>

```
  t.references :account
```

Accounted models will also require indexes for the account field.

```
  add_index :<tablename>, :account_id
```

BUT: Do not add any <i>belongs_to  :account</i> statements into any of your
models. milia will do that for all. I do recommend, however, that you add
into your <i>app/models/account.rb</i> file, one line per accounted model such
as the following (replacing <model> with your model's name):

```
  has_many  :<model>s, :dependency => destroy
```

The reason for this is that if you wish to have a master destroy account action,
it will also remove all related accounted tables and records.

Generate the account migration

```
  $ rails g model account account:references name:string:index
```

Generate the accounts_users join table migration

```
  $ rails g migration CreateAccountsUsersJoinTable accounts users
```

EDIT: <i>db/migrate/20131119092046_create_accounts_users_join_table.rb</i>
then uncomment the first index line as follows:

```
   t.index [:account_id, :user_id]
```

#### application controller

<i>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</i>
add the following line IMMEDIATELY AFTER line 4 protect_from_forgery


```
  before_action :authenticate_account!   # authenticate user and sets up account

  rescue_from ::Milia::Control::MaxAccountExceeded, :with => :max_accounts
  rescue_from ::Milia::Control::InvalidAccountAccess, :with => :invalid_account

# milia defines a default max_accounts, invalid_account exception handling
# but you can override if you wish to handle directly
```

### Designate which model determines account

Add the following acts_as_... to designate which model will be used as the key
into accounts_users to find the account for a given user. 
Only designate one model in this manner.

<i>app/models/user.rb</i>

```ruby
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    
    acts_as_universal_and_determines_account
  
  end  # class User
```

### Designate which model determines account

Add the following acts_as_... to designate which model will be used as the
account model. It is this id field which designates the account for an entire 
group of users which exist within a single accounted domain.
Only designate one model in this manner.

<i>app/models/account.rb</i>

```ruby
  class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
    
    acts_as_universal_and_determines_account
    
  end  # class Account
```

### Clean up any generated belongs_to account references in all models

which the generator might have generated 
( both <i>acts_as_account</i> and <i>acts_as_universal</i> will specify these ).

### Designate universal models

Add the following acts_as_universal to *ALL* models which are to be universal.

```ruby
    acts_as_universal
```

### Designate accounted models

Add the following acts_as_account to *ALL* models which are to be accounted.
Example for a ficticous Post model:
  
<i>app/models/post.rb</i>

```ruby
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    
    acts_as_account
  
  end  # class Post
```

### Exceptions raised

```ruby
  Milia::Control::InvalidAccountAccess
  Milia::Control::MaxAccountExceeded
```

### post authenticate_account! callback [optional]

In some applications, you will want to set up commonly used
variables used throughout your application, after a user and a 
account have been established. This is optional and if the
callback is missing, nothing will happen.

<i>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</i>

```ruby
  def callback_authenticate_account
    # set_environment or whatever else you need for each valid session
  end
```



### Account pre-processing hooks

#### Milia expects a account pre-processing & setup hook:

```ruby
  Account.create_new_account(account_params, coupon_params)   # see sample code below
```
  
where the sign-up params are passed, the new account must be validated, created,
and then returned. Any other kinds of prepatory processing are permitted here,
but should be minimal, and should not involve any accounted models. At this point
in the new account sign-up chain, no account has been set up yet (but will be
immediately after the new account has been created).

<i>app/models/account.rb</i>

```ruby
  def self.create_new_account(account_params, user_params, coupon_params)

    account = Account.new(:name => account_params[:name])

    if new_signups_not_permitted?(coupon_params)

      raise ::Milia::Control::MaxAccountExceeded, "Sorry, new accounts not permitted at this time" 

    else 
      account.save    # create the account
    end
    return account
  end

  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # new_signups_not_permitted? -- returns true if no further signups allowed
  # args: params from user input; might contain a special 'coupon' code
  #       used to determine whether or not to allow another signup
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  def self.new_signups_not_permitted?(params)
    return false
  end
```

#### Milia expects a account post-processing hook:

```ruby
  Account.account_signup(user,account,other)   # see sample code below
```
  
The purpose here is to do any account initialization AFTER devise
has validated and created a user. Objects for the user and account
are passed.  It is recommended that only minimal processing be done
here ... for example, queueing a background task to do the actual
work in setting things up for a new account.

<i>app/models/account.rb</i>

```ruby
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# account_signup -- setup a new account in the system
# CALLBACK from devise RegistrationsController (milia override)
# AFTER user creation and current_account established
# args:
#   user  -- new user  obj
#   account -- new account obj
#   other  -- any other parameter string from initial request
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  def self.account_signup(user, account, other = nil)
      #  StartupJob.queue_startup( account, user, other )
      # any special seeding required for a new organizational account

      Member.create_org_admin(user)  # sample if using Member as accounted member information model
  end
```

### View for Organizer sign ups

This example shows how to display a signup form together with recaptcha.
It also shows usage of an optional coupon field
for whatever reason you might need. If you're not familiar with haml, leading spaces are significant
and are used to indicate logical blocks. Otherwise, it's kinda like erb without all the syntactical cruff.
Leading "." indicate div class; "#" indicates a div ID. The example here is
taken from sample-milia-app.

<i>app/views/devise/registrations/new.html.haml</i>

```ruby
%h1 Simple Milia App
.block#block-signup
  %h2 New Organizational Sign up
  .content
    %span.description
      %i
        If you're a member of an existing group in our system, 
        click the activate link in the invitation email from your organization's admin.
        You should not sign up for a new organizational account.
        %br
    .flash
      - flash.each do |type, message|
        %div{ :class => "message #{type}" }
          %p= message
    - flash.clear  # clear contents so we won't see it again

    = form_for(resource, :as => resource_name, :url => registration_path(resource_name), :html => { :class => "form" }) do |f|
      .group
        = f.label :email, :class => "label"
        = f.text_field :email, :class => "text_field"
        %span.description Ex. test@example.com
      .group
        = f.label :password, :class => "label"
        = f.password_field :password, :class => "text_field"
        %span.description must be at least 6 characters
      .group
        = f.label :password_confirmation, "Re-enter Password", :class => "label"
        = f.password_field :password_confirmation, :class => "text_field"
        %span.description to confirm your password

      .group
        = fields_for( :account ) do |w|
          = w.label( :name, 'Organization', :class => "label" ) 
          = w.text_field( :name, :class => "text_field")
          %span.description unique name for your group or organization for the new account

        - if ::Milia.use_coupon
          .group
            = label_tag( 'coupon', 'Coupon code', :class => "label" )
            = text_field_tag( "coupon[coupon]", @coupon.to_s, :size => 8, :class => "text_field" )

```

### Alternate use case: user belongs to multiple accounts

Your application might allow a user to belong to multiple accounts. You will need
to provide some type of mechanism to allow the user to choose which account
(thus account) they wish to access. Once chosen, in your controller, you will need
to put:

<i>app/controllers/any_controller.rb</i>
  
```ruby
  set_current_account( new_account_id )
```

## joins might require additional accounting restrictions

Subordinate join tables will not get the Rails default scope.
Theoretically, the default scope on the master table alone should be sufficient
in restricting answers to the current_account alone .. HOWEVER, it doesn't feel
right. 

If the master table for the join is a universal table, however, you really *MUST*
use the following workaround, otherwise the database will access data in other 
accounted areas even if no records are returned. This is a potential security
breach. Further details can be found in various discussions about the
behavior of databases such as POSTGRES.

The milia workaround is to add an additional .where( where_restrict_accounts(klass1, klass2,...))
for each of the subordinate models in the join.

### usage of where_restrict_accounts

```ruby
    Comment.joins(stuff).where( where_restrict_accounts(Post, Author) ).all
```

## no account authorization required controller actions: root_path

Any controller actions, such as the root_path page, will need to skip the account & user authorizations.
For example in <i>app/controllers/home_controller.rb </i> place the following near the top of the controller:

```ruby
  skip_before_action :authenticate_account!, :only => [ :index ]
```

## using tokens for authentication

My app has certain actions which require a token for authentication, instead of a user
sign-in. These use cases include an icalendar feed for a particular user's assignments
or a generic icalendar feed for all of an organization's events. The tokens are NOT
a general replacement for user sign-in for all actions, but merely to enable a simple
restful API for certain specific actions. This section will explain how to incorporate
token authentication together with milia/devise. Please note that the application
assigns to each user an authentication token for this use, as well as creates a 
generic "guest" for the organization itself for accessing the organization-wide action.

The general scheme is to have a prepend_before_action authenticate_by_token! specified 
only for those actions allowed. This action determines the "user" required to proceed
with the action, signs in that user via devise, then falls through to the normal
before_action authenticate_account! action which establishes the current_account.

Below are some examples of this (typically the token is passed as the id parameter):

<i>app/controllers/application_controller</i>
```ruby
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE: be sure to use prepend_before_action authenticate_by_token!
# so that this will occur BEFORE authenticate_account!
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Notice we are passing store false, so the user is not
# actually stored in the session and a token is needed for every request. 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  def authenticate_by_token!
      # special case for designated actions only
    if ( controller_name == "feeder" && 
         ( user = User.find_user_by_user_feed( params ) )
       )  ||
       ( controller_name == "questions" && ['signup_form', 'finish_signup'].include?(action_name) && 
         ( user = User.find_user_by_user_feed( params ) )
       ) 
       
        # create a special session after authorizing a user
      reset_session
      sign_in(user, store: false)  # devise's way to signin the user
      # now continue with account authorization & set up
      true  # ok to continue  processing
       
    else
      act_path = controller_name.to_s + '/' + action_name.to_s
      logger.info("SECURITY - access denied #{Time.now.to_s(:db)} - auth: #{params[:userfeed] }\tuid:#{(user.nil? ? 'n/f' : user.id.to_s)}\tRequest: " + act_path)
      render( :nothing => true, :status => :forbidden) #  redirect_back   # go back to where you were
      nil   # abort further processing
    end

  end

```
<i>app/controllers/feeder_controller</i>
```ruby
  prepend_before_action  :authenticate_by_token!      # special authtentication by html token
```

<i>app/models/user.rb</i>
```ruby
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# find_user_by_user_feed -- returns a user based on auth code from params
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  def self.find_user_by_user_feed( params )
      # can get auth by either :userfeed or :id
    key = ( params[:userfeed].blank? ? params[:id]  :  params[:userfeed] )
    return nil if key.blank?  # neither key present; invalid
    return User.where( :authentication_token => key ).first  # find by the key; nil if invalid
  end
  
    def make_authentication_token
      self.authentication_token = generate_unique_authentication_token
    end

  def generate_unique_authentication_token
    loop do
      token = AuthKey.make_token   # this can be anything to generate a random large token
      break token unless User.where(authentication_token: token).first
    end
  end
```


## console

Note that even when running the console, ($ rails console) it will be run in 
multi-accounting mode. You will need to establish a current_user and
setup the current_account, otherwise most Model DB accesses will fail.

For the author's own application, I have set up a small ruby file which I 
load when I start the console. This does the following:

```ruby
    def change_account(my_id,my_account_id)
      @me = User.find( my_id )
      @w  = Account.find( my_account_id )
      Account.set_current_account @w
    end

change_account(1,1)   # or whatever is an appropriate starting user, account
```

## Whitelisting additional parameters for account/user/coupon

During the Account.create_new_account part of the sign-up process, three
sets of whitelisted parameters are passed to the method: The parameters
for account, user, and coupon. But some applications might require more or
other parameters than the ones expected by milia. Sometimes the application
might need to add some parameters of its own, such a EULA version number,
additions to an activation message, or a unique name for the account itself.

Milia has a mechanism to add additional parameters to be whitelisted. 
In <i>config/initializers/milia.rb</i> you can add a list of symbols for
the additional parameters to each of a config setting for any of the
three (account, user, or coupon). The example below shows how.

```ruby
  # whitelist user params list
  # allows an app to expand the permitted attribute list
  # specify each attribute as a symbol
  # example: [:name]
  config.whitelist_user_params = [:eula_id, :message]

  # whitelist account params list
  # allows an app to expand the permitted attribute list
  # specify each attribute as a symbol
  # example: [:name]
  config.whitelist_account_params = [:company, :cname]

  # whitelist coupon params list
  # allows an app to expand the permitted attribute list
  # specify each attribute as a symbol
  # example: [:coupon]
  config.whitelist_coupon_params = [:vendor]

```

## inviting additional user/members

To keep this discussion simple, we'll give the example of using class Member < Activerecord::Base
which will be a accounted table for keeping information regarding all the members in a given
organization. The name "Member" is not a requirement of milia. But this is how you would set up an
invite_member capability. It is in this event, that you will require the line in the Account
post-processing hook <i>account_signup</i> <pre>Member.create_org_admin(user)</pre> which also
creates the Member record for the initial admin on the account.

```
  $ rails g resource member account:references user:references first_name:string last_name:string favorite_color:string
```

ADD to <i>app/models/account.rb</i>
```ruby
  has_many :members, dependent: :destroy
```

ADD to <i>app/models/user.rb</i>
```ruby
    has_one :member, :dependent => :destroy
```


EDIT <i>app/models/member.rb</i>
REMOVE belongs_to :account
ADD
```ruby
  acts_as_account

  DEFAULT_ADMIN = {
    first_name: "Admin",
    last_name:  "Please edit me"
  }

  def self.create_new_member(user, params)
    # add any other initialization for a new member
    return user.create_member( params )
  end

  def self.create_org_admin(user)
    new_member = create_new_member(user, DEFAULT_ADMIN)
    unless new_member.errors.empty?
      raise ArgumentError, new_member.errors.full_messages.uniq.join(", ")
    end

    return new_member
      
  end
```

CREATE a form for inputting new member information for an invite
(below is a sample only)
<i>app/views/members/new.html.haml</i>
```ruby
%h1 Simple Milia App
.block#block-signup
  %h2 Invite a new member into #{@org_name}
  .content.login
    .flash
      - flash.each do |type, message|
        %div{ :class => "message #{type}" }
          %p= message
    - flash.clear  # clear contents so we won't see it again

    = form_for(@member, :html => { :class => "form login" }) do |f|
      - unless @member.errors.empty? && @user.errors.empty?
        #errorExplanation.group
          %ul
            = @member.errors.full_messages.uniq.inject(''){|str, msg| (str << "<li> #{msg}") }.html_safe
            = @user.errors.full_messages.uniq.inject(''){|str, msg| (str << "<li> #{msg}") }.html_safe

      = fields_for( :user ) do |w|
        .group
          = w.label :email, :class => "label "
          = w.text_field :email, :class => "text_field"
          %span.description Ex. test@example.com; must be unique

      .group
        = f.label :first_name, :class => "label "
        = f.text_field :first_name, :class => "text_field"

      .group
        = f.label :last_name, :class => "label "
        = f.text_field :last_name, :class => "text_field"

      .group
        = f.label :favorite_color, :class => "label "
        = f.text_field :favorite_color, :class => "text_field"
        %span.description What is your favorite color?

      .group.navform.wat-cf
        %button.button{ :type => "submit" }
          = image_tag "web-app-theme/icons/key.png"
          Create user and invite
```

## authorized accounted user landing page:

You will need a members-only landing page for after someone successfully signs into your app.
Here is what I typically do:

```ruby
# REPLACE the empty def index ... end with following ADD:
# this will give you improved handling for letting user know
# what is expected. If you want to have a welcome page for
# signed in users, uncomment the redirect_to line, etc.
  def index
    if user_signed_in?

        # was there a previous error msg carry over? make sure it shows in flasher
      flash[:notice] = flash[:error] unless flash[:error].blank?
      redirect_to(  welcome_path()  )

    else

      if flash[:notice].blank?
        flash[:notice] = "sign in if your organization has an account"
      end

    end   # if logged in .. else first time

  end

  def welcome
  end

```

## Milia API Reference Manual

### From controller-levels:

```ruby
  set_current_account( account_id )
  #  raise InvalidAccountAccess unless account_id is one of the current_user valid accounts
```

set_current_account can be used to change the current_accounted (for example, if a member
can belong to multiple accounts and wants to switch between them). See example else in this
README. NOTE: you will normally NEVER use this. Milia does this automatically during
authorize_account! so you never should at the beginning of a session.

### From model-levels:
```ruby
  Account.current_account -- returns account object for the current account; nil if none

  Account.current_account_id -- returns account_id for the current account; nil if none
```

If you need to gain access to account object itself (say to get the name of the account),
then use these accessor methods.

### From background, rake, or console-level (CAUTION):

From background jobs (only at the start of the task); 
account can either be a account object or an integer account_id; anything else will raise
exception.  set_current_account -- is model-level ability to set the current account
NOTE: *USE WITH CAUTION* normally this should *NEVER* be done from
the models ... it is only useful and safe WHEN performed at the start
of a background job (DelayedJob#perform) or at start of rails console, or a rake task.

```ruby
  Account.set_current_account( account )
    raise ArgumentError, "invalid account object or id"
```


## running tests

You must cd into the milia/test directory.
Then run test:units, test:functionals seperately. 
For some reason, rake test won't work and yields errors.

```ruby
  $ cd test
  $ rake db:create
  $ rake db:migrate
  $ rake db:test:prepare
  $ rake test:units
  $ rake test:functionals
```

### test coverage
* All models, including milia-added methods, are tested.
* Functional testing currently covers all milia-added controller methods.
* TBD: milia overrides of devise registration, confirmation controllers

## Cautions

* Milia designates a default_scope for all models (both universal and accounted). From Rails 3.2 onwards, the last designated default scope overrides any prior scopes and will invalidate multi-accounting; so *DO NOT USE default_scope*
* Milia uses Thread.current[:account_id] to hold the current account for the existing Action request in the application.
* SQL statements executed outside the context of ActiveRecord pose a potential danger; the current milia implementation does not extend to the DB connection level and so cannot enforce accounting at this point.
* The account_id of a universal model will always be forced to nil.
* The account_id of a accounted model will be set to the current_account of the current_user upon creation.
* HABTM (has_and_belongs_to_many) associations don't have models; they shouldn't have id fields
  (setup as below) nor any field other than the joined references; they don't have a account_id field;
  rails will invoke the default_scope of the appropriate joined table which does have a account_id field.
